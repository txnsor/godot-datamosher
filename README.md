Hello! This is my work in progress datamoshing shader for Godot! Functionality is currently minimal, but here is the feature roadmap:

- Datamoshing effect (FINISHED)
- Customizable screen refresh time (WIP)
- Randomization (WIP)
- Clean and tidy codebase (WIP)
- Streamlined Compute Shader Tool for all-purpose use (NOT STARTED)

This is heavily inspired by Jam2Go's video on real-time datamoshing, and some code snippets are taken (such as the GLSL noise function).
